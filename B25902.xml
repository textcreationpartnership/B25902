            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM the less backward in obeying your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to write my Thoughts of the Bishop of <hi>St. David</hi>'s Case; out of a persuasion that the best of men are not to be trusted with any greater Power, Civil or Ecclesiastical, than our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution warrants.</p>
            <p>The chief imputation within Ecclesiastical Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance which he labors under, is said to be <hi>Symony:</hi> for this, if clearly proved, without presumptions and strain'd Inferences, that a Bishop is deprivable, I shall not deny; but the Question is,</p>
            <p>Whether a Bishop of this Kingdom is, by the sole Authority of his Metropolitan, deprivable for <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till better inform'd, I cannot but hold the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, with all imaginable deference to the proper Judges; and yet shall shew that our Law is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective herein, but has appointed a proper Court for enquiring into, and punishing all such Enormities: nor is there any necessity of recourse to the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:205741:3"/>
            <p> It cannot be denied, that before the coming of the <hi>Normans,</hi> the Bishops sat in the same Court with the Civil Judges; but then if they had any judicial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

Thus it continued till the year 1085.</p>
            <p>But by a Law then made, Ecclesiastical Courts were set up separate from the Civil; and matters which concern'd

But as they often encroach'd upon the King's Courts of Law, they with great struggle kept the Power of restraining them, especially where the matter concern'd the King or any of his Peers: and therefore thÃ´ Excommunication was accounted pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual, by the Constitution

            <p>In relation to the present Question, I think these particulars may appear with great clearness.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:205741:3"/> 1. That all Deprivations of Bishops or other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, us'd, by the course of the Common Law, to be in <hi>Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho the <hi>Councils</hi> were call'd Ecclesiastical, when the Summons was only or chiefly for Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual matters, or regarding the Canon Law; the Layty were by the Constitution of the Kingdom to be parties and privies to all the Canons which pass'd, and Judgments in pursuance of those or other Canons; and thus the practice continued till the time of Archbishop <hi>Becket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever judicial Power was exercis'd in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical or Civil <hi>Councils</hi> of the Nation, devolv'd upon the House of Lords.</p>
            <p n="4">4. No Statute has taken away the Jurisdiction in these matters, which has been vested in the House of Lords.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whatever the ordinary Jurisdiction of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop may be, and how much soever preserv'd, it cannot extend to the depriving of a Bishop.</p>
            <p n="1">1st. By what has been observ'd of the first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Ecclesiastical Courts here in <hi>England</hi> it appears, that we have no occasion of enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to proceedings in such Causes before the time of <hi>W.</hi> I. after whose Accession to the Throne, till the 4th of his reign, no Prelate had been depriv'd: and then Archbishop <hi>Stigand</hi> led the way.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The High-Court of Parliament doth adjudg,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. It appearing that Deprivations were judicial Acts of Councils, and the Judgments there were the judgments of the Lords; at least that Authority has been since vested in them; Let's see whether this was ever taken away.</p>
            <p>The Statute 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
<note place="margin">24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 12.</note> for the restraint of Appeals provides, that some particular Spiritual Causes there mention'd, shall be finally adjudged and determin'd within the King's Jurisdiction and Authority, in such Courts Spiritual and Temporal, as the nature of the matter shall require, without Appeal to any forein Power. Then it provides, that Appeals shall be made in <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> as there follows, and <hi>not otherwise:</hi> from the Bishop to the Archbishop, to be definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed without Appeal to any other Person or Court;
<note place="margin">This Statute relates not to the Case where a Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is exercis'd contrary to Law.</note> if before the Archdeacon of any Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or his Commissary, to the <hi>Arches;</hi> from thence to the Archbishop, without further Appeal: if begun with the Archbishop, to be finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd as that Act has appointed; which seems to be by the Archbishop alone, no Appeal being provided for from him, except where the matter concerns the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205741:6"/>King, and then the Appeal is to be to the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Statute 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is more general,
<note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19.</note> taking in all Spiritual Causes, and provides, that Appeals shall be prosecuted as was appointed by the former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in the Cases there express'd; then it adds an Appeal from the Archbishop to the Delegates, and provides that no further Appeal be had or made from the said Commissioners.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this it has been resolv'd that there may be a Commission of Review to other Commissioners, and so the Law is taken at this day: and the reason for it is, that the Prerogative lodged in the Crown shall not be taken away by general words: but the Prerogative of the Crown is to judg in the proper Courts; which as to the Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Bishops, as I have shewn, is the House of Lords in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Statute 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. provides, that the Causes not named in the 24th shall be tried, as others are appointed by the 24th; and by that an Appeal in a Spiritual Cause concerning the King, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of a Bishop is, was to be determined in Convocation.</p>
            <p>'Tis further observable, that neither of those Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes gave a Jurisdiction to the Spiritual Courts of Archbishops or others, where they had none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only provides for Appeals in Causes within their Jurisdiction: therefore matter of Deprivation, which was never within their Jurisdiction, is <hi>casus omissus</hi> out of those Statutes; and by consequence 'tis proper to petition the Lords upon their assuming such a Jurisdiction.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:205741:6"/>
            <p> Tho the Statute 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives no Authority to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to judg originally in Causes concerning the King; yet in times of Popery they supposing that the supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in such Causes was in the Clergy,
<note place="margin">35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. N. 25.</note> both Lords and Commons petitioned the King to grant a Commission to his Clergy in Convocation to judg of the validity of his Marriage with <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Cleve:</hi> yet this was not thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without the Assent of the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament, by which that Marriage was declared void. The legality of the Commission 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. they might suppose founded upon the Statute which takes from the Pope that Headship he had assumed,
<note place="margin">26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 1.</note> and by consequence the necessity of his Consent by his <hi>Legate</hi> or otherwise to the Acts of Ecclesiastical Councils; and further annexes and unites this Authority to the Crown, and provides that the King, his Heirs and Successors, shall have full Power and Authority to visit, repress, redress, reform, and order all Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which might be by any manner of <hi>Spiritual Authority</hi> or Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>This seeming only to leave the Causes to the proper Courts;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1.</note> the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> not only annexes all Spiritual Jurisdiction to the <hi>Imperial Crown of this Realm,</hi> but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly impowers the Queen, her Heirs and Successors, to grant Ecclesiastical Commissions.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Act 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. repeals that Clause in the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and enacts that no new Court shall be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with like Power.
<note place="margin">16 <hi>C.</hi> 1. c. 11.</note> Still those parts of the Statutes 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which unite Spiritual Jurisdiction to the Crown, remain untouch'd; 'tis agreed that these are but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory of the Common Law, upon which the Jurisdiction exercis'd by Popes, was an Usurpation. Nothing therefore is more plain, than that as antiently, while the Nation was under this Usurpation, matters of Deprivation were judg'd of in the Great Council of the Nation, with the Assent of the Pope; now they are to be judg'd and determined by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament, without any interposition of the Pope: and all Judgments else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where are violations of the right of the Lords, who have this Jurisdiction properly, and originally.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:205741:7"/> 5th. Since this Power never belong'd to Archbishops, but with others, as Members of the Great Council; there's no colour to imagine that 'tis saved by the Clause in the Act 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. which provides,
<note place="margin">13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. c. 12.</note> that the Statute 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. shall not <hi>take away any ordinary Power or Authority</hi> from the <hi>Archbishops,</hi> or <hi>Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides the Evidence above, that matter of Deprivation it not within their ordinary Power; we have the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of very learned Judges,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dyer,</hi> f. 209.</note> Justice <hi>Brown</hi> and Justice <hi>Weston,</hi> who in the 3d and 4th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> refused to act as Delegates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Appeal from a Sentence of Deprivation by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> as Visitor of a College; because the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation was <hi>merely Temporal,</hi> and by a Lay Patron: where the only reason was not that the Bishop acted as a Lay Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, but as well that the Deprivation was of a Temporal Interest: and therefore the Judges held the Party might have his Remedy by Action at Common Law.</p>
            <p>And fully to come up to this Case, the Barony annexed to the Bishoprick, is to many purposes a Lay-Fee: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Constitution of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> ties the Bishops to Lay Services; and upon Contempts or the like, <hi>Rex capit se ad Baroniam:</hi> but this Sentence would deprive the King of that Remedy.</p>
            <p>Whether it naturally follows from the Premises, that the Lords in Parliament are the proper and only Judges in the Case in Question; is submitted to your Consideration by</p>
